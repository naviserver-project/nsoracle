This directory contains release 2.8 of an Oracle driver for
NaviServer/AOLserver.

The driver was originally written by Cotton Seed
(cottons@lcs.mit.edu), later modifications by Mark Dalrymple
(markd@arsdigita.com), Jin Choi (jsc@arsdigita.com), Rob Mayoff
(mayoff@arsdigita.com), Andrew Piskorski and Gustaf Neumann

This Oracle driver is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your
option) any later version.

How to Build:

* Requires GNU Make (available from the GNU project at
  http://www.gnu.org.  It is usually called "make-*.tar.gz" on the GNU ftp
  sites)

* Set ORACLE_HOME in your environment.

* Edit the Makefile and set NSHOME to the location of your NaviServer/AOLserver
  source or binary tree.

* Run "make" or "gmake" (whichever is GNU Make).

* Run "make install" or copy "nsoracle.so" and "nsoraclecass.so" to your
  NaviServer/AOLserver bin directory.  "nsoraclecass.so" is the Cassandracle Oracle
  driver; it only permits SELECT statements.


NaviServer Hints:

  Compilation works for Oracle with Oracle client libs
  Version 19.3.0.0.0 (instant client package and
  instant client package SDK, 64-bit). After downloading from e.g.,
  https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/macos-intel-x86-downloads.html
  install this library e.g. under /usr/local/src/oracle
  and set ORACLE_HOME accordingly

     export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/src/oracle/instantclient_19_8/

  After downloading the client libraries, ORACLE_HOME should include

     # includes: under $ORACLE_HOME/sdk/include/
     # libraries: $ORACLE_HOME/lib/

  To build and install the binary under NaviServer, use e.g.

     make
     make install

   calls) is at http://www.arsdigita.com/free-tools/oracle-driver.html

   Config parameters in [ns/db/driver/drivername]:

     Debug: boolean (Defaults to off)
        Enable the "log" call so that lots of stuff gets sent to the
        server.log.

     MaxStringLogLength: integer (defaults to 1024); -1 implies unlimited
        how much character data to log before just saying [too long]

     CharExpansion: integer defaulting to 1
        Factor by which byte representation of character strings can expand
        when fetched from the database.  Should only be necessary to set this
        if your Oracle is not using UTF-8, in which case a value of 2 should
        work for any ISO-8859 character set.

     EnvCharset: integer defaulting to 0
        Client-side character set id that will be used for the
        environment handle created upon connecting to the
        database. Corresponds to the charset argument of the
        OCIEnvNlsCreate function. Useful when the database uses a
        different encoding than NaviServer.

     EnvNCharset: integer defaulting to 0
        Client-side national character set id that will be used for
        the environment handle created upon connecting to the
        database. Corresponds to the ncharset argument of the
        OCIEnvNlsCreate function. Useful when the database uses a
        different encoding than NaviServer.

   ns_ora clob_dml SQL is logged when verbose=on in the pool's configuration
   section.

   To make a "safe" driver (say for servers running with DBA privileges) that
   only allows SELECT statements, define FOR_CASSANDRACLE when compiling this
